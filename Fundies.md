* Reverse Engineering
	* Essentially being given some exploit and figuring out HOW was able to exploit the target.
	* What lead up to this vulnerability being exploited.
	* This shit is NOT easy

* Computers are not user-friendly
	* Assembly Language - The link between what computers understand and what humans understand.

- Computer Science Concepts
    - You don't need a degree, and some concepts will be covered here. Ultimately it's your understanding of how computers and software work that will lead you to your success or failure.
- C/C++ _Experience_
    - For reverse engineering, experience matters more than knowing advanced C/C++ techniques. Advanced techniques are almost always just abstractions of multiple simpler concepts anyways.
- Assembly (Recommended)
    - You don't need to know a ton of assembly, but being knowledgeable and comfortable with it will make you significantly better and faster. I will use the Intel syntax because I think it's the easiest to read and it's the default for Windows tools. Note that when working with Linux, AT&T is more commonly used.
